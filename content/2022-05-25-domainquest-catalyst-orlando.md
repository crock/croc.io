On my evening dog walk, I spotted the sign for a non-denominational church by the name of Catalyst in Orlando, FL.

They use the domain name [CatalystOrlando.org](https://catalystorlando.org/) and have a really beautiful website.

It's of particular note, that the .com variant of their name appears to currently be [available for sale](https://dan.com/buy-domain/catalystorlando.com) on the DAN.com domain name marketplace by an anonymous seller.
