Today, we will be comparing WordPress and self hosted WordPress.
By the end of this post you will have the information to make the best
decision for your blog. This post will have multiple sections, including
advertising, pricing, domain and customisation of both editions of
WordPress.

## Useful Terms

WordPress.com Hosted Service
WordPress.org Self Hosted

These terms may be used interchangeably.

## Pricing & Limitations

WordPress Hosted offers a free version of there software hosted
within there platform. Upgrades start from £36/Yr to remove some
limitations and can go up to £430/Yr to remove all limitations from
the platform.
WordPress Self Hosted on the other hand will cost you £40-80/yr to
keep online. However, even the lower end of this budget scale will
allow you to fully utilise WordPress, including displaying your own
adverts and installing custom themes and plugins.

## Domain Offerings

WordPress Hosted allows you to host your blog using there
`.wordpress.com` subdomain suffix. However this is incredibly limiting
for most users, since it makes it more difficult for there blog to be
found on the major search engines. Usually you have to manually
submit a website to the major search engines, that can still take
weeks for your website to be found by using a simple search engine
query. However, you can purchase your own domain and link it to
your WordPress account, although you will be required to upgrade to
the £36/Yr plan for it to connect.

WordPress Self Hosted usually requires you to own a domain to be
able to publicly broadcast your blog which start from £5/yr. Although,
some web hosting providers offer free domain registrations on
certain billing terms. Selected Hosting providers may even offer Free
Subdomains to utilise.

## Advertising Options

WordPress Hosted currently only supports external advertising on
premium accounts, which cost a minimum cost of £85/Yr.
Additionally, Free WordPress Hosted Accounts displays WordPress
adverts, whilst on the other hand WordPress self hosted does not
participate in the same practices.
WordPress Self Hosted is a free for all in relation to advertisements,
you are in full control. The only thing you have to setup for
advertising is an advertising account, there is no need to upgrade any
WordPress accounts to gain access to this feature.

## Customisation Options

WordPress Hosted sadly does not allow the option to use plugins,
however they do this for the security of there users. Customisation it
self is relatively similar on both platforms when your using the front
end editing, however on the other hand if you want more advanced
customisation you will be required to purchase the CSS upgrade.
WordPress Self Hosted allows plugins, however some WordPress
verified hosting providers can disable this feature on there own
accord; they can either completely disable plugins or they can stop
you from installing new plugins that they do not have activated on
your account. WordPress self hosted customisation is unrestricted,
you can simply access your file manager provided by your web
hosting provider to gain the ability to edit and customise CSS files, no
need to pay for a ridiculous service upgrade to access a feature you
can get for free if you self host.

## Conclusion and Recommendations

WordPress Hosted is best for small personal blogs, where you can
make posts to pass time and to share with your friends and family.
WordPress Self Hosted is recommended for business or development
teams that require customisation, unrestricted plugins and the ability
to earn money from advertisements.
