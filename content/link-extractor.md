Spotted a recent post on an Android forum today that was asking for an application to convert a list of URLs into a list of clickable links. I thought it was a useful idea that is relatively simple to implement, so I threw something together in a few hours and deployed it as a PWA on Netlify.

The web app is available at [linkmod.croc.io](https://linkmod.croc.io/).

You can view the source code for the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/crock/linkmod/).
