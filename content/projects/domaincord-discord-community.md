Domaincord is a Discord community for domainers. It is a place to discuss domain names, domain investing, and domain sales. It is also a place to discuss other topics such as cryptocurrency, web development, and more.

The community currently has over 800 members and is growing steadily every day.

Visit the Domaincord website at [domaincord.com](https://domaincord.com) to learn more. I built the site using [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and host it at [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
