Dropcatching, sometimes referred to as domain sniping, is the process of bidding on expiring domain names in hopes that the dropcatching service can successfully register the domain on the customerâ€™s behalf as soon as it drops.

All of the popular dropcatching services are competing and the one with the most resources allocated to any particular name will most likely win.

It definitely helps to shop around for the best prices and take advantage of many of the free, downloadable lists that most dropcatching services provide.

Using tools like our own [Dropfilter](https://domaincord.com/dropfilter) app, you can easily filter these huge lists based on customizable criteria.
