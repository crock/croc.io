Spotted this interesting service van filling up at a Wawa. The company calls themselves *Time Machine Contracting &amp; Restoration* and uses a logo reminiscent of the film *Back to the Future*. I personally love the logo, but I’d be cautious as the owner of that company because of possible copyright infringement.

You can visit the company’s website by visiting [timemachinegc.com](https://timemachinegc.com/).
