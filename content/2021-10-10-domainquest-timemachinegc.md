Spotted this interesting service van filling up at a Wawa. The company calls themselves _Time Machine Contracting &amp; Restoration_ and uses a logo reminiscent of the film _Back to the Future_. I personally love the logo, but I’d be cautious as the owner of that company because of possible copyright infringement.

You can visit the company’s website by visiting [timemachinegc.com](https://timemachinegc.com/).
