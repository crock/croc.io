Since its founding in 2015, Discord has grown into one of the largest social chat apps for millennials and Generation Z on the web today. With over 150 million monthly active users as of March 2022, there are no signs of slowing down anytime soon.

It’s no surprise that third-party services are piggybacking on the success of Discord with all kinds of integrations to enhance a Discord user’s experience with the platform. Popular integrations include all kinds of chat bots and public directories to easily find new Discord communities to engage with.

## Discord Domain Lists

I have gathered a list of domains that have been registered within the last 10 years containing the keyword “discord” or variations of the spelling word or name puns.
