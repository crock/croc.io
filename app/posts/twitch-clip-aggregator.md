PlayBattleRoyale.com was my first major project that I built in early 2019. It immediately led to me getting my first tech job. I kept running site even after getting a job for 13 months and only took it down after Twitch implemented a change to their API that would have required me to re-write the authentication flow and I didn't have the time to do it.

After I took the live site down, I published the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/crock/clip-aggregator) for others to learn from.
