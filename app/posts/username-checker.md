This is the first of many projects that I have built and I built it in a weekend as my first foray into learning the Python programming language. This command-line program has gone through several iterations and received many updates since it went public in 2017. It has been starred 50 times on [GitHub](https://github.com/checker/cli) as of January 2023.

The purpose of this program is to check the availability of words in plain text lists as usernames on the various social media platforms. It supports several different platforms and is the **only** username checker that supports a list of words as input.
It uses multi-threading to check the availability of usernames in parallel, which makes it very fast. It also supports proxies and can be configured to use a proxy list.
